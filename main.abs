Data from national accounts show no effect of change in net saving
or consumption, in ratio to market-value capital, on change in growth

that capital growth and acceleration arrive without help from net
saving or consumption restraint. We explore ways in which this is
possible, and discuss implications for economic teaching and public
policy.
