Data from national accounts show no effect of change in net saving
or consumption, in ratio to market-value capital, on change in growth
rate of market-value capital (capital acceleration). Thus it appears
that capital growth and acceleration arrive without help from net
saving or consumption restraint. We explore ways in which this is
possible, and discuss implications for economic teaching and public
policy.

\section{Introduction and overview}\label{introduction}}

Many economists over the centuries have reasoned that net saving, or equivalently net investment\footnote{As reported in national accounts; they differ only by statistical discrepancy. Also see Appendix \hyperref[appendix-a]{A}.}, should tend to give equal capital growth. Economists since the early
nineteenth century have added the proviso that net saving cannot
safely outpace innovation; more capital must mean capital redesigned for
greater productivity if economies are to escape risk of capital glut and
diminishing returns
(\citet{westEssayApplicationCapital1815, ricardoEssayProfitsVol1815, malthusEnquiryNatureProgress1815}).
Roy \citet{harrodEssayDynamicTheory1939}
described that limit for safe net saving, meaning the rate of
imagining and developing new ideas for more productive forms of capital,
as the ``warranted rate''. Harrod, and many other economists of his time
and since, have focused on growth of output rather than of capital, but
have modeled growth of output by first assuming the equivalence of net
saving and capital growth, within the warranted rate, and then
looking for effects of that capital growth on later output growth.

Some other economists, including John  \citet{raeNewPrinciplesPolitical1834} and John Stuart 
\citet{millPrinciplesPoliticalEconomy1848} (see Appendix \hyperref[appendix-c]{C}), argued that capital growth might also be explained
by a rise in productivity of capital and labor already extant. Ways
might be found for existing factors to produce more, that is, and so to
allow more consumption, or more capital growth, or any mix of the two,
without inputs of net saving. Robert
\citet{solowTECHNICALCHANGEAGGREGATE1957} allowed that possibility for
``disembodied'' growth, where plant and products already existing are
repurposed or redeployed in more productive ways.

We test between those two explanations of capital growth, by net
saving or by increase in productivity of capital and labor already
in existence, by comparing net saving to concurrent change in
market-value capital in 86 countries. As changes in net saving
are expected to be associated with opposite changes in consumption, we
also compare change in consumption to concurrent change in capital
growth (capital acceleration). All data are drawn from national accounts
of those countries as collated on the free website \href{https://wid.world/}{World Inequality Database}.

Those test results from data for net saving/capital ratio and for consumption/capital ratio
are easiest to reconcile in an interpretation that change in neither affects
change in capital growth rate.\footnote{Conditional on investment of replacement saving to offset depreciation first. See Section \ref{sec-difftest}
below.} This finding would support the views of Rae and Mill, and of
Solow as to disembodied growth. It would suggest that capital growth, even in
acceleration, arrives without help from net saving or consumption restraint.
Net saving, if so, raises the physical quantity of capital, but not the
aggregate value, and so reduces the value per unit.

The data are most easily explained by the present value principle,
and by production efficiencies enabled through innovation. Value is
created in the mind of the market at the moment when prospective cash
flows are discounted. It is created only if the market sees a path, step
by step, from the start, to practical realization of those prospective
cash flows. Then capital growth arrives when the market first evaluates
prospective cash flows, and is realized eventually in physical outcomes
insofar as the market has predicted correctly. That is to say that capital
growth, in the mind of the market, precedes and pays for any needed investment
in new plant and equipment.

Meanwhile the innovator
acquires materials and plant capacity and labor skills at market prices
determined by their uses in current technology, but applies them more
productively until competition catches up. It is that temporary market
advantage to the innovator which explains capital growth without net
saving in a practical and mechanical sense, while the present value
principle gives the explanation in terms of market valuation. This idea
will be called ``free growth theory'' for easy reference.

It predicts only at the largest scales, and only for the private sector.
Individuals and groups and even small economies can grow through
investment from outside. That possibility is foreclosed only at the
scale of all capital and all economies together. The public sector,
meanwhile, responds to political rather than market choices, and grows
or shrinks accordingly.

If free growth theory is right, tax policy and other policy to encourage
saving over consumption should be reviewed. These policies
include the higher tax on ordinary income than on capital gains, and the
double tax on corporate dividends.

Inferences for economic teaching include the obvious ones for growth
theory and for net saving in general. They include others as well.
One of the central doctrines of the marginalist revolution has held that
market realization converges to producer cost, when that cost includes
imputed interest on assets owned. Net saving gives producer cost,
and falls short of market realization in the presence of technological
growth from new ideas. Meanwhile the doctrine that net income equals
consumption plus net saving is put into question by evidence offered
here suggesting that net saving increases the physical quantity of
capital, but not the aggregate value. In general, economics might
consider relying less on book value and net investment, and more on market value and on the
power of ideas.

\section{Net saving, capital growth and capital acceleration}\label{net-saving-and-capital-growth}}

This study compares net saving \(S_{net}\) to concurrent growth in
market-value capital \(K\) from data in national accounts. Capital
growth \({\Delta K}_{i}\) in each year \(i\) for each reporting country
is found as \(K_{i} - K_{i - 1},\) and compared to \(S_{net,i}\)
reported for that year and country. As we will be testing for
differences between \(\Delta K\) and \(S_{net,i}\), we begin by writing
%
\begin{equation}
    \Delta K_{i} = z_{i} S_{net,i} + Q_{i}\ .\label{eq-1}
\end{equation}
%
Here "net saving efficiency" \(z\) is the fraction of \(S_{net}\) actually realized in growth of capital value \(K\). \(Q\) means the sum of market noise, which may prove
positive or negative or zero, plus any part of capital growth explained
by concurrent productivity gain as described by Rae and Mill, and by
Solow as to disembodied growth. We call this sum of noise and
productivity gain ``free growth'' in that it costs no net saving.

The object of testing is to find effects of \(S_{net}\) on concurrent
\(\Delta K\), and so to help evaluate historic and current teachings as
to those effects. We submitted above that most teaching, with exceptions
noted as to Rae, Mill, and Solow, and within the warranted rate,
predicts net saving to differ from concurrent growth in market-value
capital only by market noise which tends to balance out over scale and
time. Free growth \(Q\) in Eq.~\eqref{eq-1}, in that case, will give
the market noise converging to zero. That consensus prediction, which we
will challenge, will here be called ``thrift theory''; \(S_{net}\), in
thrift theory, is expected to converge to \(\Delta K\) if held within
the warranted rate. That is,
%
\begin{equation}
    E(z) = 1\ , \quad E(\Delta K) = S_{net} \quad \text{and} \quad E(Q) = 0,
\quad \text{if} \quad
\frac{\Sigma S_{net}}{\Sigma K} \leq u\ ,\quad \text{in thrift theory,}
\label{eq-2}
\end{equation}
%
where:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \(\Sigma S_{net}\) is collective net saving over the economy
\item
  \(\Sigma K\) is collective capital over the economy before current
  \(\Sigma S_{net},\) and
\item
  \(u\) is the warranted rate.
\end{enumerate}

Free growth theory makes the opposite prediction that net saving adds no capital value, and that capital growth, at the largest scales in the private sector, is explained wholly by increased productivity of skills and materials already present. Thus, referring to Eq.~\eqref{eq-1},
%
\begin{equation}
    E(z) = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad E(\Delta K) = Q \quad \text{in free growth theory.} \label{eq-3}
\end{equation}
%
\(E(z)\), \(E(\Delta K)\) and \(E(Q)\) here give the expected values of \(z\), \(\Delta K\)
and \(Q\) respectively. Expected value means predicted average of outcomes
over all observations.
We will test those predictions against data for saving and capital growth taken from national accounts.
As secular economic growth has tended to make
later stocks and flows larger than earlier ones, we first divide by
\(K\) (normalize) to avoid overweighting of more recent years in finding
that average. Division of Eq.~\eqref{eq-1} by \(K_{i - 1}\) gives
%
\begin{equation}
    \frac{(\Delta K)_{i}}{K_{i - 1}} = \frac{z_i S_{net,i}}{K_{i - 1}} + \frac{Q_{i}}{K_{i - 1}} \ .\label{eq-4}
\end{equation}
%
The first term in Eq.~\eqref{eq-4} gives capital growth rate \(g(K)\). The fraction \(S_{net,i}/K_{i-1}\) in the second term is a
variant of the Keynesian net saving rate \(s_{net}\) where capital
rather than output becomes the denominator. This flow will show 
as \(s^{*}\), with the subscript ``net''
left implicit, and with the understanding that the denominator shows
market-value capital rather than output.
The third term in Eq.~\eqref{eq-4} will be called free growth rate and
shown as \(q_s\). That is,
%
\[g{(K)}_{i} = \frac{(\Delta K)_{i}}{K_{i - 1}} \ , \quad
s^{*}_{i} = \frac{S_{net,i}}{K_{i - 1}} \ , \quad \text{and} \quad
q_{i} = \frac{Q_{i}}{K_{i - 1}} \ ,\]
%
so that Eq.~\eqref{eq-4} can be shown more compactly as
%
\begin{equation}
g(K)_{i} = z_i s^{*}_{i} + q_{i} \ .\label{eq-5}
\end{equation}
%
By the definition \(q = \frac{Q}{K}\), an expected value \(E(Q) = 0\)
implies \(E(q) = 0\). Application of Eq.~\eqref{eq-2} to
Eq.~\eqref{eq-5} now gives
%
\begin{equation}
    E(g(K)) = s^* \quad \text{and} \quad E(q) = 0\ , \quad \text{under thrift assumptions,}\label{eq-6}
\end{equation}
%
where ``thrift assumptions'' are that thrift theory is correct and that
the warranted rate is not exceeded. Eqs. \eqref{eq-2} and \eqref{eq-4}, meanwhile, give
%
\begin{equation}
    E(g(K)) = q \quad \text{in free growth theory.}\label{eq-7}
\end{equation}
%
Note here that free growth theory makes no prediction as to the quantity \(s^*_i\). Rather it predicts \(E(z)=0\) in Eq. \eqref{eq-5}, so that \(s^*_i\) takes no part in calculation of \(\Delta g(K)_i\). 

The prediction in Eq. \eqref{eq-6} can be tested directly from data for market-value capital and net saving in national accounts. We define the "auxiliary thrift index" by 
%
\begin{equation*}
    \theta^* = \frac{s^*}{g(K)}\ , \quad \text{that is, and test the prediction} \\
\end{equation*}
%
\begin{equation*}
    E(\theta^*) = 1 \quad \text{under thrift assumptions.}
\end{equation*}
%
Results show in Fig. \ref{fig-s_c_theta_plots} and Tables \ref{tbl-4} and \ref{tbl-5}. They show \(\theta^*\) as averaging something near \(\frac{1}{2}\), and with wide variance from country to country and from year to year.
Regression of \(s^*\) on \(g(K)\) is found at 0.2103.
Free growth theory, again, makes no prediction as to relationships between net saving and capital growth.

The concepts of correlation, covariance and regression are founded on the principle that causal relationships among variables tend to be revealed in simultaneous changes. Thus the two theories are best tested in their
implications for changes in capital growth, which we call capital acceleration and show as $\Delta g(K)$. First note that Eq.~\eqref{eq-5} allows
%
\begin{equation}
    \Delta g (K)_{i} = \Delta(z s^*)_{i} + (\Delta q)_{i}\ , \quad \text{where}\label{eq-8}
\end{equation}
%
\[\Delta g(K)_{i} = g(K)_{i} - g(K)_{i - 1} \ , \quad
     \Delta (z s^{*})_{i} = z_i s^{*}_{i} - z_{i-1} s^{*}_{i - 1} \ , \quad \text{and} \quad
(\Delta q)_{i} = q_{i} - q_{i - 1} \ .\]
%
For any variables \(a\) and \(b\), we may reason
\(E(a - b) = E(a) - E(b)\). By this and by Eqs. \eqref{eq-7} and
\eqref{eq-8}, then,
%
\begin{equation}
    E(g(K)) = \Delta s^* \quad \text{and} \quad E(\Delta q) = 0\ , \quad \text{under thrift assumptions.}\label{eq-9}
\end{equation}
%
Eq. \eqref{eq-9} implies
\begin{equation}
    E \left(\frac{g(K)}{\Delta g(K)} \right) = \frac{\Delta s^*}{\Delta g(K)} \quad \text{and} \quad E \left(\frac{\Delta s^*}{\Delta g(K)} \right) = 0\ , \quad \text{under thrift assumptions.} \label{eq-10}
\end{equation}
%
To test this prediction of thrift theory, first define
\begin{equation}
    \theta_s = \frac{\Delta s^*}{\Delta g (K)} \quad \text{and} \quad \varphi_s = \frac{\Delta q}{\Delta g (K)}\ . \label{eq-11}
\end{equation}
%
Note here that:
\begin{enumerate}[i)]
\item \(\theta_s = 1\) and \(\varphi_s = 0\) if  \(z = 1\); 
\item \(\theta_s = 0\) and \(\varphi_s = 1\) if  \(z = 0\); and
\item \(\theta_s + \varphi_s = 1\) \hspace{2.3em} if \(0<z<1\). In general, then
\end{enumerate}
%
\begin{equation}
    \theta_s + \varphi_s = 1\ . \label{eq-12}
\end{equation}
%
By Eqs. \eqref{eq-10} and \eqref{eq-11}, continuing, 
%
\begin{equation}
    E(\theta_s) = 1 \quad \text{and} \quad E(\varphi_s) = 0 \ , \quad \text{under thrift assumptions.} \label{eq-12a}
\end{equation}
%
\(\theta\) and \(\varphi\), without subscripts, will be called the ``thrift index'' and
``free growth index'' respectively. \(\theta_{s}\) and
\(\varphi_{s}\) give their values as found from data for change in net
saving. 
%
Expected values, again, are predicted averages of outcomes. Thus Eq. \eqref{eq-12a} and thrift theory can be tested by finding average values of \(\theta_{s,i}\) and comparing findings to the expected value \(\theta = 1\). First we find
%
\[\overline{\theta_{s,i}} = \frac{1}{m} \sum^{m} \theta_{s,i} \quad \text{and} \quad
\overline{\varphi_{s,i}} = \frac{1}{m} \sum^{m} \varphi_{s,i}\ ,\]
%
where \(m\) is the number of observed values of \(\theta_{s,i}\) and
\(\varphi_{s,i}\), and test the predictions
\[
\overline{\theta_{s,i}} \cong 1 \quad \text{and} \quad \overline{\varphi_{s,i}} \cong 0\ , \quad \text{under thrift assumptions.}
\]

Calculations of \(\overline{\theta_{s,i}}\) and
\(\overline{\varphi_{s,i}}\) are not expected to show 1 and 0 exactly,
under thrift assumptions, so that \(\overline{\theta_{s,i}}\) and \(\overline{\varphi_{s,i}}\) are not exactly equal to \(\theta_s\) and \(\varphi_s\), because the number of samples \(m\) is finite.

Free growth theory, meanwhile, referring to Eq. \eqref{eq-12a}, does not predict the exact opposite findings \(\theta_s = 0\) and \(\varphi_s = 1\). It rather expects a value of \(\varphi_s\) somewhat less than unity for reasons shown in Section 4.

Fig.~\ref{fig-si_plots} shows average values of \(\theta_{s,i}\) and
\(\varphi_{s,i}\) for 86 countries, both unweighted and weighted to GDP,
over the period 1980-2022.
Table~\ref{tbl-wid_si_table} shows associated regressions of \(\Delta s^*\) and \(\Delta g_s\) respectively on \(\Delta g (K)\) at 0.1000 and 0.9000. Average values of \(\varphi_s\) for the 86 individual countries show in Table~\ref{tbl-indicator_table}.
To control distortions brought by small
absolute denominators, years were screened out where \(|\Delta g(K)|\)
was found at less than 0.01 (see Section~\ref{sec-displays}). Results show \(\overline{\varphi_{s,i}} = 0.936\) and \(\overline{\theta_{s,i}} = 0.064\) for data weighted to GDP. These findings largely support free growth theory, but could suggest a small role (6.4\%) for thrift as well. This possibility will be discussed in Section~\ref{sec-difftest}. We will first test thrift theory from a different approach.

\section{Consumption and capital growth}\label{consumption-and-capital-growth}}
Thrift theory expects capital growth and growth rate to equal net saving and the net saving/capital ratio \(s^*\) respectively (Eqs. \eqref{eq-2} and \eqref{eq-6}). It expects that consumption, capital and output can all grow at the net saving/capital ratio, which will here show as \(c^*\), if \(s^*\) holds constant over time (balanced growth)\footnote{The notation \(c^*\), as with \(s^*\), shows an asterisk to distinguish its meaning \(c^* = \frac{C}{K}\) from the Keynesean \(c = \frac{C}{Y}\).}. It expects, likewise, that any change in capital growth rate must be explained by an equal change in \(s^*\) (Eq. \eqref{eq-9}), and infers an equal and opposite change in \(c^*\) on the reasoning that consumption restraint provides the only source for a gain in net saving, while consumption recovery becomes the natural beneficiary of output freed by a decline in net saving. This inference allows Eq. \eqref{eq-9} to be extended to the form 
%
\begin{equation}
    E(\Delta g(K)) = \Delta s^* = -\Delta c^*, \quad \text{under thrift assumptions,} \label{eq-13}
\end{equation}
%
where \(c^*\) is defined by
%
\begin{equation*}
    c^*_i = \frac{C_i}{K_{i - 1}} \ .
\end{equation*}
%
Free growth theory, conversely, predicts that net saving contributes nothing to capital growth, and hence that net saving through consumption restraint, at the collective scale and in the private sector, is sacrifice with nothing in return. Free growth theory expects as before that costless increases in productivity of capital already present account for all capital growth and acceleration. 

As in Eq. \eqref{eq-11}, we prepare to test thrift theory by first reasoning that Eq. \eqref{eq-13} implies \(E(-\Delta c^*) = \Delta g (K)\), and thus
% 
\begin{equation}
    E(\frac{-\Delta c^*}{\Delta g (K)}) = \frac{\Delta g (K)}{\Delta g (K)} = 1\ , \quad \text{under thrift assumptions.} \label{eq-15}
\end{equation}
%
For notational convenience, as in Eq. \eqref{eq-11}, define \(\theta_c\), the thrift index for application to consumption data, by \(\theta_c = (-\Delta c^*/\Delta g (K))\). Here again, the only alternative explanation of capital acceleration appears to be gain in productivity of capital and labor already present. This source was called free growth and shown as \(q\). Then define
%
\begin{equation}
    \theta_c = \frac{-\Delta c^*}{\Delta g (K)}\quad \text{and} \quad \varphi_c = \frac{\Delta q}{\Delta g (K)}\ , \label{eq-16a}
\end{equation}
%
where \(\varphi_c\) shows the free growth index for data for consumption.

As free growth and saving through consumption restraint exhaust the possibilities of accounting for capital acceleration, we find
%
\begin{equation}
    \theta_c + \varphi_c = 1 \ , \quad
    \label{eq-16}
\end{equation}
as in Eq. \eqref{eq-12}. By Eqs. \eqref{eq-15} and \eqref{eq-16a}, now,
\begin{equation}
    \theta_c = 1 \quad \text{and} \quad \varphi_c = 0 \ , \quad \text{under thrift assumptions.}
    \label{eq-17}
\end{equation}
We infer \(\theta_c \cong \overline{\theta_{c,i}}\) and \(\varphi_c \cong \overline{\varphi_{c,i}}\) as before, and test thrift theory by comparing average yearly values of $\theta_{c,i}$ and $\varphi_{c,i}$ to its predictions $\overline{\theta_{c,i}} \cong 1$ and $\overline{\varphi_{c,i}} \cong 0$.

Fig.~\ref{fig-c_plots} shows results of tests of these predictions from
data for consumption reported in national accounts. Consumption was
measured as the sum of personal consumption expenditure PCE and
government consumption expenditure GCE. Capital K was again measured at
market value. Again, years showing \(|\Delta g(K)| < .01\) were screened
out to control small denominator effects. 
The generally higher values of \(\varphi_c\) (1.142) then \(\varphi_s\) (0.936) shown in the data will be discussed in Section \ref{sec-difftest}.

\section{Differences in test results\label{sec-difftest}}

Fig.~\ref{fig-si_plots} and Table~\ref{tbl-wid_si_table} show \(\theta_s\) to average 0.064, and regression of \(\Delta s^*\) on \(\Delta g(K)\) to average \(0.100\), across all years and countries GDP-weighted. Fig. \ref{fig-c_plots} and Table~\ref{tbl-wid_c_table}, meanwhile, showed these overall averages as \(-0.142\) for \(\theta_c\), and as \(-0.376\) for regression of \(-\Delta c^*\) on \(\Delta g (K)\). These differences might be explained by systematic mismeasurements of \(C\), \(K\) and \(S_{net}\) in national accounts. In that case, the evidence would leave open the possibility of some role for net saving (6.4\%) in capital growth.

There is another possible interpretation. Regression or correlation or covariance among variables such as net saving and capital growth suggests causal relationship among them, but does not in itself reveal the direction of causality. Thrift theory accepts the natural inference that net saving is the cause, and capital growth the effect. Logic and experience, however, also suggest that adverse shocks such as war or depression might lower capital values despite all saving and investment, and might then motivate negative net saving (dissaving), meaning suspension of replacement saving, in order to maintain consumption. When peace and prosperity return, higher incomes will allow restoration of replacement saving to offset depreciation. Capital growth need not depend on positive net saving at any point, but rather allows an upward normalization of net saving from a negative value to zero. In this interpretation, change in capital growth becomes the cause, rather than the effect, of change in net saving.

This possibility could help explain differences between the measurements of GDP-weighted \(\varphi_s (0.936)\) and \(\varphi_c (1.142)\), without need to assume systematic mismeasurements of \(S_{net}\), \(K\) and \(C\). Note here that the finding \(\varphi > 1\) is possible in principle when gain in productivity allows growth in capital and consumption at the same time (see the quote from Mill in Appendix C.) We welcome further study to resolve these uncertainties.

\hypertarget{mechanics-of-free-growth}{%
\section{Mechanics of free growth}\label{mechanics-of-free-growth}}

Some growth is capital widening, where structures and implements
increase in number but do not change in design. Capital widening,
however, is practical only so far before glut and diminishing returns
set in. Further growth from that point must come from capital deepening,
meaning improvements in the design of capital.
\citet{solowContributionTheoryEconomic1956a} noted a kind of middle
ground between capital widening and capital deepening in the disembodied
growth mentioned earlier; ships carrying coals to Newcastle can raise
prospective cash flows, and hence present value, by reversing the
business plan. But Solow, who came to conclusions similar to ours from
different evidence, puzzled as to how capital growth without net
saving could be possible for capital deepening through ``embodied''
growth, where products of new design are made from plant of new
design.\footnote{The terms capital deepening, capital widening, embodied
  growth and disembodied growth are all Solow's.}


The solution, we suggest, is that embodied growth is disembodied growth
on a finer scale. At each step toward realization of the new plant and
products, raw materials and products and labor skills and plant capacity
currently available on the market are adapted to new uses. The innovator
pays for these inputs at a market price determined by their value in
established productive uses, but applies them innovatively to realize
higher prospective cash flows, and hence higher present values, to the
innovator
(\citet{marshallPrinciplesEconomics1890, schumpeterTheoryEconomicDevelopment1934}).
This difference in present value realized less price paid will here be
called the ``innovator's reserve'', meaning reserve price for inputs of
capital and labor.\footnote{i.e., capital and labor inputs are worth
  more to the innovator in that the innovator applies them in ways to
  realize greater returns. The present value of additional cash flow
  enabled by this advantage in return quantifies the innovator's reserve
  and equivalently the non-random component of free growth.} The innovator's reserve quantifies the
part of free growth explained by productivity gain as distinct from
random market noise. As such, it is the quantity added to depreciation
saving to enable embodied growth, so that net saving is never
needed.

Our findings support those of \cite{picketyCapitalIsBack2014} and \cite{kurz2023market} as to the market power of innovators to explain capital growth beyond net saving. Again, we go farther by questioning the assumption that net saving contributes even a part of capital growth.

\hypertarget{optimum-investment-policy}{%
\section{Optimum investment policy}\label{optimum-investment-policy}}

Data and arguments adduced, with uncertainties discussed in Section~\ref{sec-difftest}, suggest that the optimum amount of
saving, at the global scale, is replacement saving to offset depreciation, and nothing
more. That would not mean book depreciation, as this study has stressed
differences between book and market values. Up to a point, it should be
possible to analyze the composition of market capital, and to model
depreciation of the whole. A better plan, as
\citet{solowContributionTheoryEconomic1956a} wrote in response to
Harrod's knife edge argument (Harrod, \citeyear{harrodEssayDynamicTheory1939}), is to
trust the market to maximize rate of return, and to sense the point
where glut begins and returns fall.\footnote{Harrod had argued that
saving must hit the warranted rate exactly or risk positive
feedback through the operation of the output/capital ratio
(accelerator).}
%
Markets do so imperfectly when tax and other public policy reward
saving over distributions and consumption. Findings in this paper
suggest review of such policies. These include the double tax on
dividends, and the greater tax rate on ordinary income than on capital
gains. Effects of removing the double tax, and removing the difference
between tax rates on ordinary income and on capital gains, could be
revenue-neutral and non-partisan if the corporate tax were raised to
match, if the tax rates on ordinary income and on capital gains met
somewhere between, and if thoughtful grandfathering eased the
transition.

\section{Inferences for national accounts and macroeconomics}

We have attempted to show that net saving does not tend to equate to capital growth, and indeed contributes no part of capital growth. If our argument proves correct, then national accounts, and the teachings of macroeconomics (macro) which they express, are constructed on a fundamental misperception. We would therefore welcome any critiques of our findings as a matter of academic and public interest.

\section{Inferences for microeconomics}

Microeconomics ("micro") studies the mutual effects of supply, demand and price. It teaches that producer cost, including interest as the cost of time, tends to equilibrate to market value realized. We have proposed an exception in the innovator's reserve; the innovator pays the going rates for skills and materials needed, but applies them to make products of greater market value.

\section{Inferences for inflation}

If free growth theory is correct, then net investment adds a superfluous cost to capital growth, while decreasing market value per unit through capital glut. Both effects would tend to contribute directly to capital inflation, and indirectly to inflation of consumer goods by adding depreciation costs. This consideration adds to the case for urgent attention to our argument, and for more study to confirm or refute it.

\hypertarget{net-output}{
\section{Net output}\label{net-output}
}
The concept of net output is found in our discussions, but not in our equations. Net output means value added. Appendix B will show an argument that to equate value added to the sum of consumption and capital growth, and neither less nor more, would miss two components, one negative and one positive, in value added to human capital, and that both of these components are unmeasurable by known means. Since we work here from measurable data for consumption and net saving and market value capital, we did our best to reason from those three quantities alone.

All our data are drawn from \href{https://wid.world/document/distributional-national-accounts-guidelines-2020-concepts-and-methods-used-in-the-world-inequality-database/}{Distributional National Accounts (DINA)} from the free online database \href{wid.world.com}{World
Inequality Database (WID)}. This source collates data from national accounts and tax data
of 105 countries in constant currency units, and adjusts them where needed to conform to current standards of the System of National Accounts
(SNA) published by the United Nations. We show results for the 86 of
those countries which report all three of the factors, namely net
saving, consumption and market-value capital, needed for deriving
the thrift and free growth indexes. WID's source for these data is national accounts.

Consumption $C$ in our text and equations is reproduced from the sum of Government Final Consumption Expenditure (mcongo)\footnote{\label{widnote}WID code} and Private Expenditures of Households and NPISH (mconhn). This sums government expenditure GCE and personal consumption expenditure PCE. Net saving $S_{net}$ and market-value $K$ are taken from net national saving (msavin) and market-value Capital Wealth (mnweal) respectively. GDP, which we use only for weighting purposes in Figs. 1 and 2, is reproduced from GDP (mgdpro).

\hypertarget{sec-displays}{%
\section{Displays}\label{sec-displays}}

Eqs. \eqref{eq-13} and \eqref{eq-16} show
\(\theta_s + \varphi_s = 1\) and \(\theta_c + \varphi_c = 1\). Some
displays here and in the
\href{https://web-appendix.shinyapps.io/Sources\_of\_Capital\_Growth/}{web appendix}
save space by showing \(\varphi_s\) and \(\varphi_c\) only, leaving
\(\theta_s\) and \(\theta_c\) implicit as their complements to unity.
The \href{https://web-appendix.shinyapps.io/Sources\_of\_Capital\_Growth/}{web
appendix} includes displays of \(\varphi_s\) and \(\varphi_c\) for
each year in each country over the report period. These tend to show
upward and downward spikes in values of \(\varphi_s\) and \(\varphi_c\)
in some years. Those spikes tend to be associated with small absolute
values of denominators, in these cases \(\Delta g(K)\), in those
countries and years. Small denominators magnify errors in measurements
of numerators. Worse, when denominators are small, small mismeasurements in them might reverse the term in sign.

To maximize reliability of test results, we apply a range of screens to
omit years where absolute denominators fall below a given
threshold. Some displays show data for all years, regardless of denominator size.
Others screen out all years where
absolute denominators are less then .01, then .025, then continuing upward in
increments of .025 to a maximum screen of .15. \(\varphi_s\) and
\(\varphi_c\) are plotted for each country unscreened and at each of the
seven successive levels of screening. All displays applied a screen of .01. 
The denominator whose absolute value is screened is capital acceleration
$\Delta g(K)$ or capital growth rate \(g(K)\) in all displays. 

Screening out years where absolute \(\Delta g(K)\) or $g(K)$ is small would cost
little in informative value even if measurements were exact. In those
years, there is little capital acceleration or capital growth, positive or negative, for
either thrift theory or free growth theory to explain. Market noise
alone might account for \(\Delta g(K)\) or $g(K)$ in such years. Screening reduces
the number of observations, but increases the reliability and
informative value of each.

\hypertarget{disclaimers}{%
\section{Disclaimers}\label{disclaimers}}

We accept that capital growth is impossible without capital replacement first, to make up losses to depreciation, and that the only source of capital replacement is replacement investment. Thus we accept the necessity and efficacy of replacement investment. We dispute only the efficacy of net investment in realizing capital growth after replacement investment has made up for depreciation.

\hypertarget{discussion-and-conclusions}{%
\section{Discussion and conclusions}\label{discussion-and-conclusions}}

Capital glut is the condition warned against by West, Ricardo, Malthus
and Harrod. It is loosely defined as oversupply of capital at the
current state of technology. We will not attempt a more exact definition
here. Findings shown in our displays, anyhow, suggest that net
saving raises the physical quantity of capital, say in number of
shops, manufacturing plants or finished goods of similar design, without
raising aggregate value of capital, and so contributes to capital glut.

These findings challenge the teachings that capital growth is effected
by net saving enabled by consumption restraint, and that producer
cost, including imputed interest as the opportunity cost of capital,
converges to market realization. Evidence showing \(\overline{\varphi_{s,i}} \cong 1\)
and \(\overline{\varphi_{c,i}} \cong 1\) suggests that all capital growth is free, and
consequently that market realization, in the presence of innovation,
exceeds producer cost by the entirety of capital growth. Meanwhile the same evidence, which indicates that net saving adds no capital value, suggests a review of the teachings that consumption plus net saving gives net income, and that consumption plus net investment gives net output. Appendix B will also question the latter teachings.

Embodied growth is disembodied growth on a finer scale. It redeploys or
repurposes existing labor skills, raw materials, and plant capacity, as
well as existing finished goods, to achieve higher returns than
available from the customary uses which determine their prices. The
present value of yields from this advantage in return, or equivalently
the innovator's reserve, defines the non-random component in free growth.

\section*{Appendix A. \hspace{0.5em}Equivalence of saving and investment}\label{appendix-a}
}

Any usage which treats saving and investment as equal must deal with the fact that saving held in cash is not investment in the usual sense of spending on productive capital, and contributes nothing to output. \cite{keynesGeneralTheoryEmployment1936} defined that unspent saving as intended saving, and actual saving as the part so spent.

We suggest that investors seek to maximize return, within risk tolerance, and will sometimes hold saving in cash or equivalents at zero return in recessions and depressions when positive returns cannot be found, and so when investing in the usual sense would tend to reduce capital and output rather than increase them. Thus investment could have the usual meaning in usual times, when prospective returns bring animal spirits, and could include saving in cash when not. It is in this sense that we equate saving to investment.

\section*{Appendix B.\hspace{0.5em}Net output with human
capital}\label{appendix}}

Human capital is impractical to measure, as it leaves little market
record other than for its rental income in pay and investment cost in schooling. Thus national accounts
leave it implicit, and allow us to infer what we can from data for pay and schooling. Those
accounts are founded on the principle, sound when terms are appropriately redefined, that net output,
or value added, is expressed in the sum of capital growth and net
outflow from the value-added chain. In national accounts, then, where
physical capital is the whole of capital while net outflow of the chain
is the whole of consumption, the reasoning is
%
\begin{equation}
Y = \Delta K + C \ , \quad \text{neglecting human capital.\footnotemark}\label{eq-a1}
\end{equation}
\footnotetext{Where $\Delta K$, mistakenly, we argue, is measured as $S_{net}$.}
%
It is possible in principle to model a value-added chain which includes human
capital, and to compare findings with those shown in Eq.~\eqref{eq-a1}.
Let human capital $H$, in that new model, stand as the last link in the
value-added chain. Adapting the classic illustration of the value added
principle, say that farms produce wheat, mills convert the wheat to
flour, bakeries convert the flour into bread, and humans convert some of
the bread, called invested consumption, into human capital. The net
outflow from this extended value-added chain is not all of consumption,
but only pure consumption, meaning the part remaining after the part invested in human capital (invested consumption) is
subtracted\footnote{The concepts of invested consumption, pure consumption, self-invested work and human depreciation were introduced in \cite{schultzInvestmentHumanCapital1961}.}. By this reasoning, the principle
that net output is expressed in capital growth plus net outflow gives
%
\begin{equation} 
Y = \Delta K + \Delta H + C_{p}\ , \quad \text{allowing human capital,}\label{eq-a2} 
\end{equation}
%
where \(C_{p}\) gives pure consumption.

Yoram \citet{ben-porathProductionHumanCapital1967} reasoned
that growth in human capital equals invested consumption plus
self-invested work less human depreciation\footnote{Equation 4 in
  Ben-Porath's paper, summarizing his first three equations. His terms and
  notation differ from ours. The concepts of invested consumption were
  also introduced by \citet{schultzInvestmentHumanCapital1961}.}.
Let \(C_{s},\ W_{s}\) and \(D(H)\) show these flows respectively.
Thus the combined arguments of Schultz and Ben-Porath arrive at
%
\begin{equation}
C = C_{s} + C_{p} \quad \text{and}
\quad \Delta H = C_{s} + W_{s} - D(H)\ , \quad \text{allowing human capital.}\label{eq-a3}
\end{equation}
%
Substitution of these equations into Eq.~\eqref{eq-a2} finds
%
\[Y = \Delta K + C_{s} + W_{s} - D(H) + C_{p} \quad \text{and consequently}\]
%
\vspace{-5ex}
\begin{equation}
    Y = \Delta K + C + W_{s} - D(H)\ , \quad \text{allowing human capital,}\label{eq-a4}
\end{equation}
%
if Schultz and Ben-Porath and the reasoning here are right.

\cite{millPrinciplesPoliticalEconomy1848}, book 1, chapter 5, section 4, includes:
\begin{quote}
If it were said, for instance, that the only way to accelerate the increase of capital is by increase of saving, the idea would probably be suggested of greater abstinence, and increased privation. But it is obvious that whatever increases the productive power of labour creates an additional fund to make savings from, and enables capital to be enlarged not only without additional privation, but concurrently with an increase of personal consumption. 
\end{quote}

This passage may be the first clear statement of what we call free growth theory. His use of the words "accelerate" and "concurrently" suggest that his path of reasoning was something like ours, and that he meant what we call free growth rather than the alternating phases of higher and lower saving rates pictured in thrift theory.
