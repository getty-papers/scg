Hi Gordon,

Just a quick note: the tables and graphics are a little disorganized. Let’s leave their positioning as is until the update is ready.

Regarding my PhD, I graduated this May and have decided not to pursue a doctorate at this time. I may revisit it when I’m over 40, because right now it’s definitely not economically viable nor will it make me happy; I’ve been in school forever at this point. Instead, I’ve been pursuing my entrepreneurial aspirations, and so far it has been going rather successfully. Over the past year or so, I’ve completed enough consulting projects to focus on customer experience automated evaluation with training and reporting. Basically, I use AI to analyze text transcripts of customer interactions, grade them, and create a training video -- surprisingly empty niche. It seems to be a good direction with both short-term and long-term growth, so I’m super excited about where I can take it.

Best,
Nikita
