Hello Gordon,

A few notes:

First, there were points on the graph, albeit pretty faint; I have made them more visible.

Second, for the table with per-country averages, I cannot weight by GDP because it is only a single country.

Third, the \( c^_/s^_ \) graph is the same as \( C/S \). Therefore, I used Consumption and Savings instead (the ratios are the sameâ€”I checked). There were also a lot of outliers in the graph, so I zoomed in to focus on the majority of the points.

Best,

Nikita
