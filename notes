The finding \(\frac{s^*}{g(K)} = 0.481\) reveals average observed proportions between \(s^*\) and \(g(K)\), and does not of itself reveal causal relatedness between those two variables. Causal relatedness is shown rather by the degree of constancy in proportions, and thus on regression of \(s^*\) on \(g(K)\) found at \(0.1857\).

\(\theta_s\) or \(\frac{\Delta s^*}{\Delta g(K)}\), measured at \(\theta_s^* = 0.064\), gives a separate measure of causal relatedness between \(s^*\) and \(g(K)\) as explained. Regression of \(\Delta s^*\) on \(\Delta g(K)\), found at 0.1000, gives a measure of causal relatedness between \(\Delta s^*\) and \(\Delta g(K)\). Although these findings refute thrift theory, which had expected \(\frac{s^*}{\Delta g} = \frac{\Delta s^*}{\Delta g(K)} = 1\) on the assumptions that all net saving is recovered in capital growth, and that there is no other source of capital growth, might these small but positive findings allow the possibility that some net saving is recovered in capital growth?

Any realistic theory must account for the chance that replacement saving will sometimes not be enough to offset depreciation. This shortfall is likeliest in prolonged downturns, where loss of income motivates households to forego net saving, and then to invade capital by putting off maintenance expense and replacement investment in order to protect consumption. Effects will include a positive effect on regression of \(s^*\) on \(g(K)\), and an upward effect on \(\frac{\Delta s^*}{\Delta g(K)}\), as \(s^*\) and \(g(K)\) decline together in response to downward pressure on income. This interpretation could fit the appearance in Fig. [2] that \(\frac{\Delta s^*}{\Delta g(K)}\), shown as \(\theta^*_s\), found higher values during the period of the dot com and subprime crises.

In general, it might be expected that households stabilize consumption by building up reserves through net saving when earnings are higher, and deplete them when earnings are lower, as described in the life cycle theory of saving (Modigliani 1953) or the permanent income hypothesis (Freedman 1957). Free growth theory explains the rise in earnings as caused by a rise in productivity of current plant and implements and skills, and so predicts the same effects on regressions and \(\frac{\Delta s^*}{\Delta g(K)}\) as does thrift theory, but from an opposite causality.

Without including the possibility that some net saving is recovered, data are easiest to reconcile with free growth theory, where all capital growth is explained by productivity gain. Pending further study, we will proceed on this interpretation.
